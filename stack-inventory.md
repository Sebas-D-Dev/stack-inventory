# Stack Inventory 🧠📦

Stack Inventory is an AI-powered inventory management system designed to go beyond the basics. Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel using Prisma with PostgreSQL, it blends practical tooling with intelligent features like stock forecasting, smart categorization, and purchase optimization integrations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Inventory CRUD operations** with category and vendor management
- **Authentication and authorization** via NextAuth
- **AI-powered stock forecasting** using time-series predictions
- **Smart product categorization** using NLP APIs or custom models
- **Deal integration engine** to fetch best prices from external vendors (Amazon, Google Shopping, etc.)
- **Purchase recommendation system** with pending approval queue
- **Inventory Insights Dashboard** powered by custom reordering algorithms
- **Changelog-powered Blog** to explain system decisions and updates

### 🧠 AI-Powered Enhancements

- **Stock Level Forcasting:** Use time-series forecasting (like ARIMA or Prophet via a Python microservice) to predict stock depletion and proactively suggest reorders.
- **Smart Categorization:** Use an AI model to auto-tag or classify incoming inventory items based on name, supplier, or usage pattern (could be fine-tuned embeddings or OpenAI APIs).
- **Chat Assistant for Inventory Queries:** Embed a small AI chat module trained on your inventory schema to help users query via natural language (e.g. “Which items expire next month?”).

### 🔗 Integrated Purchase Optimization

- **External Deal Scraper:** Set up a scraper or use affiliate APIs (like Amazon Product API, BestBuy, or even Google Shopping API) to find best offers for low-stock items.
- **Purchase Intent Workflow:** Automatically create a “pending additions” queue based on price, delivery time, and user approval—a lightweight purchasing assistant!

### ⚙️ Algorithmic Backbone

- **Custom Reordering Algorithm:** Instead of static thresholds, use a weighted scoring system: sales frequency, lead time, seasonal trends.
- **Clustered Product Analysis:** Use k-means or DBSCAN to group inventory items by usage, pricing, or category for better dashboard insights.

### 📰 Blog Template Twist

- Share reorder decisions and why they happened (“Forecasting suggests demand spike in Q3”).
- Weekly spotlight on most volatile or bestselling items.
- Explain how AI modules are helping streamline decisions—great for transparency if you’re demoing to others.
