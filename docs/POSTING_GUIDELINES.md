# POSTING GUIDELINES

**Guidelines for User Posts in Stack Inventory Management System**

**I. Posting Purpose & Clarity:**

1. **Clear Subject Line:**  Always begin with a concise subject line summarizing the post's purpose.  Examples: "Urgent Reorder Request - USB-C Hubs," "Low Stock Alert - Ergonomic Chair Mats," "Vendor Performance Issue - TechNova."

2. **Specific Details:** Provide all necessary information in your post.  Vague posts hinder efficient problem-solving.  Include:
    * **Product Name:**  (e.g., "4K Ultra Monitor," not just "Monitor")
    * **Quantity:**  (e.g., "Need 10 more Ergonomic Chair Mats")
    * **Reason:** Explain the need (e.g., "High demand during summer season," "Replenishing stock after recent sale").
    * **Relevant Category & Vendor (if applicable):** This helps with quick identification and analysis.

3. **Actionable Requests:** Clearly state what action you need.  For example, instead of "Problem with TechNova," write "Request investigation into TechNova's 0% reliability and consistently late deliveries."


**II. Data Accuracy & System Optimization:**

4. **Accurate Quantities:** Double-check quantities before posting. Inaccurate data leads to inefficiencies and potential stockouts.

5. **Use High-Impact Tags:** Utilize the "HIGH IMPACT" tag when necessary to flag urgent issues requiring immediate attention. This prioritizes alerts for the SUPER_ADMIN team.

6. **Attach Supporting Documents (If Necessary):** If applicable, attach relevant documents like sales reports or purchase orders to support your request.

7. **Leverage AI Insights:** Before posting, check the AI-generated insights for potential solutions or relevant information. This minimizes redundant requests and promotes proactive problem-solving.

8. **Update System Data:** Ensure all your actions are properly logged within the system.  This improves data accuracy and allows for better trend analysis.


**III. Specific Examples Based on Current Context:**

* **For Reorder Requests:** Refer to the vendor reliability data before posting.  For example, avoid placing an order with TechNova (0% reliability) unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize vendors like OfficePro and Hardware Solutions due to their 100% reliability.

* **Low Stock Alerts:**  While we currently show no low stock items, these guidelines are crucial for future use.  The system should be configured to trigger alerts automatically, but users should still report if they notice discrepancies.

* **Vendor Performance:** Report any inconsistencies between the system’s vendor performance data (like TechNova’s 0% reliability) and your experiences. This helps refine the AI’s analysis.

* **Summer Season Impact:**  Given the summer season and increased demand, anticipate needs proactively.  Users can post projections of anticipated increases for products like  Ergonomic Chair Mats (if applicable to the season) or consider adding summer-related products to the inventory for future sales.


**Next Steps:**

1. **System Health Improvement:** The system health score is critically low (38/100). Investigate and address the underlying issues. The "Last Backup" information is unknown; schedule regular backups immediately.

2. **TechNova Investigation:** The urgent order from TechNova and their 0% reliability demand immediate attention. Investigate the root cause of their poor performance.

3. **User Training:** Conduct user training sessions on these guidelines to ensure consistent and effective use of the system.  Focus on data entry accuracy and leveraging the AI features.

4. **Daily Active User Engagement:** Analyze why daily active users are currently zero. This could indicate issues with user accessibility, training, or the system itself.  Improving user engagement is key to maximizing the system's potential.


By implementing these guidelines, we can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of communication within the Stack Inventory Management system.  These improvements will better support your role as SUPER_ADMIN and help leverage the system’s AI capabilities to their full potential.
